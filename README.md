Useful repos and links I find over time.

## Links (Unsorted)

- [AMD GPUs for LLM inference](https://blog.mlc.ai/2023/08/09/Making-AMD-GPUs-competitive-for-LLM-inference)

- [The AI Index](https://www.aiindex.org/)

  - The AI Index is an effort to track, collate, distill and visualize data relating to artificial intelligence. It aspires to be a comprehensive resource of data and analysis for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.

- [outlines by normal-computing](https://github.com/normal-computing/outlines)

  - Outlines ã€° is a library for neural text generation. You can think of it as a more flexible replacement for the generate method in the transformers library.

  - Outlines ã€° helps developers guide text generation to build robust interfaces with external systems. Provides generation methods that guarantee that the output will match a regular expressions, or follow a JSON schema.

  - Outlines ã€° provides robust prompting primitives that separate the prompting from the execution logic and lead to simple implementations of few-shot generations, ReAct, meta-prompting, agents, etc.

  - Outlines ã€° is designed as a library that is meant to be compatible the broader ecosystem, not to replace it. We use as few abstractions as possible, and generation can be interleaved with control flow, conditionals, custom Python functions and calls to other libraries.

  - Outlines ã€° is compatible with all models. It only interfaces with models via the next-token logits. It can be used with API-based models as well.
