- [outlines by normal-computing](https://github.com/normal-computing/outlines)

  - Outlines is a Python library to write reliable programs for interactions with generative models: language models, diffusers, multimodal models, classifiers, etc. It provides a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to make prompting easier, constrained text generation and is natively concurrent. It integrates well with the rest of the Python ecosystem: tools, vector stores, etc.
